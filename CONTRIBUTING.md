# Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Clone your repository
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
4. Run `yarn build`
5. Add all files edited `git add .`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
7. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
8. Submit a pull request

Don't edit files under `dist` folder, those are generated after running `yarn build` command, edit files under `src` folder instead.
